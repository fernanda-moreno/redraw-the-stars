## Installation
1. To run this application on your computer, download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Once you have Processing downloaded, clone my repository onto your computer and open the file within the Processing 
application.
3. Run the application by hitting the Play button at the top.
4. Click anywhere on the app screen to place a star and notice that every star you insert connects to form a constellation.
Speak or make some noise while you place the stars and see how the colors of the current connecting line and
background stars change! :)
